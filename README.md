# KTH Course: DD2480 - Group 13 | LAB 1: Decide

This repository contains the solution for the ```DECIDE()``` function for the (version 5) "Launch Interceptor Program: Requirements Specification" (Knight, Leveson, 2016). It is the first lab-assignment in the course DD2480, at KTH. 

The program is a "hypothetical anti-ballistic missile system" where the assignment is to write the ```DECIDE()``` function. The function will determine if an interceptor should be launched, based on various combinations of so-called Launch Interceptor Conditions (LIC's). Depending on the combination of LIC's, the function will return a final ouput as a boolean signal; ```"YES"``` or ```"NO"```.
